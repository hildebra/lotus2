#sdm options file to control sequence quality filtering, demultiplexing and preparation (can also be used without demultiplexing)
#* indicates alternative quality filtering options, saved in *.add.fna etc. files separately from initial quality filtered dataset
#sequence length refers to sequence length AFTER removal of Primers, Barcodes and trimming. this ensures that downstream analyis tools will have appropiate sequence information
#options with a star in front are lenient parameters for mid qual sequences (only used for estimating OTU abundance, not for OTU building itself).
