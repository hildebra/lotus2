#sdm options file to control sequence quality filtering, demultiplexing and preparation (can also be used without demultiplexing)
#* indicates alternative quality filtering options, saved in *.add.fna etc. files separately from initial quality filtered dataset
#sequence length refers to sequence length AFTER removal of Primers, Barcodes and trimming. this ensures that downstream analyis tools will have appropiate sequence information
#experimental options for ONT (Q20!) data
#use at your own risk

#set fastqVersion to 1 if you use Sanger, Illumina 1.8+ or NCBI SRA files. Set fastqVersion to 2, if you use Illumina 1.3+ - 1.7+ or Solexa fastq files.

CheckForMixedPairs	T
#checks if whole amplicon was reverse-transcribed sequenced (not switched, just reverse translated)
CheckForReversedSeqs	T

#this option should be "T" if your amplicons are possibly shorter than a single read in a paired end sequencing run (e.g. if the 16S amplicon length is 200bp in a 250x2 miSeq run, set this to "T"). This option increases runtime by 10%, if in doubt just set to "T". *Requires* LinkerPrimerSequence and ReversePrimer to be defined in mapping file. Also used to remove fwd and rev primer from long Pacbio sequences
AmpliconShortPE	T


#mostly used for PacBio data: check if  more than once the reverse primer occurrs on reads, if yes, cut length to first fwd-rev primer pairing
